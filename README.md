# HyperionDev Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Level 1 - Task 13 - JSON - Music storage

## Description

This task was about using the web storage API and JSON to create a small website. The website allows you to store, edit or delete music tracks.

**JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation**, is a syntax for converting objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans into a format that can be transferred between the web server and the client. Like XML, JSON is language independent.

The **Web Storage API** stores data using key value pairs. This mechanism of storing data has to a large extent replaced the use of cookies for storing data about the current user's interaction with the website.

The Web Storage API allows us to store state information in two ways:

1. sessionStorage stores state information for each given origin for as long as the browser is open.
2. localStorage stores state information for each given origin even when the browser is closed and reopened.

## Instructions

These were the instructions I was given to guide me:

**Compulsory Task 1 - Music storage website**
Follow these steps:

- Create a webpage that can be used to let a user store information about a catalogue of music.
  - The user should be able to add information (e.g. artist, title, album, genre etc) about their favourite tracks.
  - All the information about all the tracks added by the user should be listed on the webpage.
  - The user should also be able to remove or edit information for a track.
